AR is both interactive and registered in 3D as well as combines real and virtual objects. Milgram's Reality-Virtuality Continuum is defined by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino as a continuum that spans between the real environment and the virtual environment comprise Augmented Reality and Augmented Virtuality (AV) in between, where AR is closer to the real world and AV is closer to a pure virtual environment, as seen in Fig.{\thinspace}1.1 [2].",

abstract="The widespread diffusion of mobile technologies enables to reach a multitude of virtual contents, which crowd the infinite space of the internet: a huge extension that could not be transferred into a paper-based medium. Nowadays, traditional print media must face the growing diffusion of internet-based media. An opportunity to face the decreasing trade of paper-based media is provided by Augmented Reality (AR). The creation of Mixed Reality (MR) environments seems to offer the possibility to build a bridge between real and virtual, between print media and internet-based media. However, the integration of AR and print media still needs to deal with the issue of the automated content creation. In this paper we bring into focus the problem of the lack of automation in hybrid media and we propose a different paradigm, which results useful to design new editorial models. Furthermore, the system that we defined enables the creation of individualized reading experiences through the integration of a recommender system. By means of the definition of the domain ontology of the system, we have been able to define a prototypical implementation of the described automated AR content creation process, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

In addition to this, in these experiments, there are many costly chemicals needed which may not be useful after those experiments. Augmented reality is the emerging field for training and education purpose nowadays. In the proposed work, we use augmented reality platform to perform analytical chemistry experiments which can eliminate the risks during experiments and also useful to prevent the waste of chemicals. The proposed algorithm deals with different computer vision techniques such as marker-based augmented reality, adaptive hand segmentation, gesture recognition, and hand pose estimation to manipulate virtual objects and perform experiment virtually. The algorithm is proposed for ego-centric videos to give real experience of experiments to the user and it is implemented on Android smartphone with virtual reality (VR) glasses. Such algorithm can be useful for smart educational environments in future.",

The vertices are placed on concentric circles and the edges are routed as curves without crossings. Here we take the opposite view. A graph with a given partitioning of its vertices onto k concentric circles is k-radial planar, if the edges can be routed monotonic between the circles without crossings. Radial planarity is a generalisation of level planarity, where the vertices are placed on k horizontal lines. We extend the technique for level planarity testing of [18,17,15,16,12,13] and show that radial planarity is decidable in linear time, and that a radial planar embedding can be computed in linear time.",
